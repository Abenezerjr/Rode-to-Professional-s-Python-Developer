**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python is a powerful paradigm that allows you to structure your code by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. Let's dive into the basics:

1. **What Is OOP in Python?**
   - OOP is a way of organizing programs by modeling real-world entities as
    **objects**.
    Each object contains both:
    **data** (like raw materials in an assembly line) and
    **behavior** (actions performed by each assembly line component).
   - Think of a program as a factory assembly line, where each step processes material and transforms it into a finished product.
   - Properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects, making code more modular and maintainable.

2. **Defining a Class: The Blueprint**
   - A **class** serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that type will have.
   - You can define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def __init__(self, name):
             self.name = name

         def bark(self):
             print(f"{self.name} says woof!")
     ```

3. **Creating Objects (Instances)**
   - Once you have a class, you can create **instances** (objects) based on that blueprint.
   - Use the class name followed by parentheses to create an instance.
   - Example:
     ```python
     my_dog = Dog(name="Buddy")
     my_dog.bark()  # Output: "Buddy says woof!"
     ```

4. **Attributes and Methods**
   - **Attributes** are variables associated with an object (e.g., `name` in the `Dog` class).
   - **Methods** are functions associated with an object (e.g., `bark()` in the `Dog` class).

5. **Inheritance**
   - Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing one (the **parent class**).
   - The new class (the **child class**) inherits attributes and methods from the parent class.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Puppy(Dog):
         def play(self):
             print(f"{self.name} is playing fetch!")

     my_puppy = Puppy(name="Rocky")
     my_puppy.bark()  # Output: "Rocky says woof!"
     my_puppy.play()  # Output: "Rocky is playing fetch!"
     ```

6. **Polymorphism**
   - Polymorphism allows different classes to share the same method
   name but behave differently.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Cat:
         def sound(self):
             print("Meow!")

     def make_sound(animal):
         animal.sound()

     my_cat = Cat()
     make_sound(my_dog)  # Output: "Buddy says woof!"
     make_sound(my_cat)  # Output: "Meow!"
     ```

Remember, OOP helps you create organized, reusable, and efficient code. Dive deeper into this fascinating world of Python OOP to build robust applications! üêç

Example : restaurant
that has three real world entities(class)
one: chef
2: waiter
   (1 joe
   2 don) object instance of class
3: cleaner
four: Manager

let say that were going to model a waiter:

what it has: (we call it attributes);- like variable it a variable attach particular object
is_holding_plate=True
tables_responsible=[4,5,6}

what it does: (we call it methods) :- it likes function, but we call it methods b/c it function that a particular modeled
def take_order(table,order):
   # takes order to chef
def take_payment(amount):
     #add money to a restaurant


##################
Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from the class, also known as instantiation.
Attribute: An attribute is a characteristic of an object that holds data. In Python, for example, if an object o has an attribute a, it would be accessed as o.a.
Method: A method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python, all methods are functions, but not all functions are methods. Methods perform actions using the object‚Äôs attributes or change the object‚Äôs state.
Here‚Äôs a simple Python example to illustrate these concepts:

Python

class NAS:
    # This is a class attribute
    storage_capacity = '10TB'

    def __init__(self, location):
        # This is an instance attribute
        self.location = location

    # This is a method
    def report_status(self):
        return f"NAS located at {self.location} with storage: {self.storage_capacity}"

# Creating an object of the NAS class
my_nas = NAS('Data Center 1')

# Accessing the object's attribute
print(my_nas.location)  # Output: Data Center 1

# Calling the object's method
print(my_nas.report_status())  # Output: NAS located at Data Center 1 with storage: 10TB
